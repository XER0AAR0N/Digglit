## ✨ Features

- Fast navigation without the browser clutter
- Somewhat light-weight built in RUST using WebView2

(PLEASE READ)
Please note, this project kinda is as-is and I'm unsure wether to make this anything more than a "WebView"
for the Digg site, this is mainly due to being unaware on the Digg teams stance on third party clients, hence this
being a WebView2 application, loading the Digg website using a client spoofer. (seems Digg blocks projects like this
by default, as the site doesn't load without spoofing)
